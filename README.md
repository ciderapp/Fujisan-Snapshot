# Fujisan Snapshot

This snapshot of **Fujisan** represents an early developmental backend for Cider based on Wails, while the main Wails modifications are not publicized the initalization code and some other fundamentals are. It is provided solely for **research purposes** and is not intended for compilation or deployment. Key functions and data have been omitted for security reasons, and it is no longer actively maintained or used.

## Purpose

Fujisan was the backend platform used during Cider's development. It handled essential services like basic RPC tooling and window creation but is now outdated. This release allows researchers to study the architectural decisions made during its development, but it is **not suitable** for operational use.

## Security Notice

This snapshot has been stripped of sensitive functions, and the code is safe to publish under the **Cider Collective Research License (CCRL)**. Any attempts to use this code beyond research purposes are strictly prohibited, and the snapshot is provided **as-is**.

## License
